## Overview

Textual entailment has mainly focused on inference from written text in monologue. Recent years also observed an increasing amount of conversational data such as conversation scripts of meetings, call center records, court proceedings, as well as on- line chatting. Although conversation is a form of language, it is different from monologue text with several unique characteristics. The key distinctive features include turn-taking between participants, grounding between participants, different linguistic phenomena of utterances, and conversation implicatures. Traditional approaches dealing with textual entailment were not designed to handle these unique conversation behaviors and thus to support automated entailment from conversation scripts. This projects intends to address this limitation.
